Software developers do not practice waterfall development and deliver a single binary annually to their customers.

To do so, they add a GitHub Action to their repo.This GitHub action downloads the latest LunaTrace CLI every time.It then grabs the package lock files and, the future, it grabs all of the call sites from the code. Then it uploads these to LunaTrace for ingestion.for auth, we can use the GitHub Token OIDC provider.Pros:  -   Doesn't require the security team to onboard in order to get started-   Can be done by an individual dev in a lunch break-   Dangles a carrot because we can show people cool metrics about their code-   Can be done without any crazy onboarding flow (just requires the action to exist in the repo and that's auth for us!)I think there is still a bug in the install repo flow when it comes to changing the selected repos.

Having a thought or feeling that is seen by many as objectively wrong should be a warning sign that that person should probably receive more attention and support. I did not really live in a community where it was ok to be racist, sexist, homophobic, so it is sometimes hard to understand how people can hold such beliefs so intimately, so it can be hard to understand how people like that exist. Why does anyone care if a guy wants to fuck another guy? You don't have to watch, I don't think the gay guys really want you to watch either. Where does the fear originate from? Who was the first person to say, \"hey, no more of this stuff, that is unnatural\". Maybe the first people saw this lifestyle as a threat to humans having kids? Maybe a powerful dude was jealous he couldn't get with some other guy he was in to? It makes me sad to think of all the people in history who never had a chance to truly feel like themselves because of one reason or another. They were too scared to share their thoughts and feelings because the social rejection that they might face. A law might be preventing them from being themselves, their family's acceptance being on the line. Fear and being beaten into submission is however, something that should probably exist in moderation. If we didn't have something to guide us in a direction and keep us on track, most of us would probably be jerking off and smoking weed everyday. I have to some extent beaten myself into submission to be writing my notes everyday. Sitting down and learning to embrace my note taking ritual instead of forgetting to document meaningful work and ideas that I am working on. Habits make us better. You can only start a habit and continue it when you have seen the cost benefit analysis. If you aren't the one who is motivated enough to start the habit, someone else who sees its value is going to, hopefully, be there to make sure you do it.

i try to almost never use pointers, and when i do i double check that i can\u2019t just pass a struct. i really wish that wasn\u2019t in the language, but it\u2019s the performance trade off in the language. i have found that following ubers style guide has really helped my code be a lot more consistent https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md The language kind of beats you into thinking in a certain way which can be annoying for a lot of developers who just want to code, but i have seen enough of it to be able to write fairly consistent design patterns that, to me, don\u2019t necessarily make different coding tasks immediately easier, but trading off upfront velocity with longer term use ability (ie. i can write a python script in seconds, but 99% of those i will never use again, it might take a minute for me to do the equivalent in go, but that script with \u201cgo build\u201d becomes a standalone binary, \u201cgo test\u201d verifies it works, you can generate docs for it. the reason i like go is the same you like bun, it just has answers to all the questions you would commonly ask of code. but untyped javascript rots this experience because you can no longer go to the actual line of code being used. before generics, go also had the problem with \u201cinterface{}\u201d you would get stuck reading code and it would suck. having a fully connected, intuitive experience, in my opinion, is what", "doc_id": "696350b2-b7dd-4bb3-aa2c-b84b2dd80a14", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "74088d3f9efd3e0179086ac1b0d8f81752112bdf9175ebe027c4cc12ce59cf5c", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "eb20ba45-5b9d-4cbe-a07c-4b611be6ee71", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1821}, "image": null}, "375a4355-e9b7-4a7b-9c17-6e1aa5926902": {"text": "of code being used. before generics, go also had the problem with \u201cinterface{}\u201d you would get stuck reading code and it would suck. having a fully connected, intuitive experience, in my opinion, is what makes developers better at coding and designing systems. you can look up and you can look down and see how people have written something and when you want to make your own you can communicate your code without any overhead.- visualizing software architecture https://c4model.com- clean architecture https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2/- visual programming with go https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/- #business-ideas connected coding\t- when you program, your ideas should be effortless. code should flow out of your fingertips and into production without a second thought. or should it? we want to think the solution to development is the most effortless process that you can have. But the truth is, we want coding to be intuitive. The difference being that instead of not needing to think, and constantly being in flow while programming, we really want to always know where to find a solution when we experience a problem. If i don\u2019t know how to check if a number is even or odd in javascript, I know that someone has probably made an npm module to solve this problem. Using npm is intuitive. If i want to test my go application, I know i have to write a test function with a certain name so that \u201cgo test\u201d will recognize it. Wait, how is that intuitive? I have to name a function something specific? What if i have a typo in the name or don\u2019t have the name capitalized. My tests wouldn\u2019t run and the solution wouldn\u2019t be intuitive.\t- Intuition comes from somewhere. We get shown how something works and then we continue to use those patterns.

I don\u2019t know how to do every possible thing imaginable, but I know, through intuition, where to find the things I don\u2019t know. If I use go test to enforce code coverage, and my code coverage fails, i know some tests aren\u2019t running. If tests aren\u2019t running, I will go to where the tests are and go through my intuition checklist: \u201ctests are only visible to go if they look like \u2018Test*\u2019, do my tests look like that\u201d?\t- Maybe this is a deal breaker for you. I am not going to use go because of these silly function naming conventions. My language handles this much better, all I have to do is X. Well i\u2019m curious, if for some reason your tests don\u2019t run, what does your intuitive check list look like? Does a certain script need to exist somewhere with a specific name, otherwise the tests will fail silently?\t- The reason I like using go is because the intuitive checklist that I need to have is the same checklist I can use for every go project that exists, assuming they are using the builtin go tools. But why wouldn\u2019t they? They are pretty simple to use and do the things they need to do reliably. It is not a perfect language by any means, but the short list of things I need to keep in my intuitive checklist make it pretty desirable for me when I think about building a complicated system.\t- How do you design a system? If i run \u201cpython serve.py\u201d on a server, is that a system? Yeah, why not. It runs, it listens for requests, it responds with data. But what happens when the server crashes? The requests wont be responded to, the system is broken. So I fix this problem  by using an infinite loop that always keeps the program running, even if it crashes.

A system gets more complicated as time goes on, and that is why developers get paid the big bucks! It\u2019s a lot of work to manage a system, keep it running, and make it better.\t- This complexity of building and maintaining a system is only ever really experienced by the engineers working on it. The managers, product owners, CTO, CEO, they are only exposed to glimpses of this process, as they should, it\u2019s not their job. Business requirements get sent down, from on high, through the ranks and get translated into context specific ideas and actions. \u201cOur customer has pictures of puppies.\u201d becomes \u201cWe need to store pictures of puppies.\u201d and then \u201cMake an API endpoint that stores a picture in an S3 bucket.\u201d\t- Today, when we are keep track of these translated ideas, they are passed verbally in meetings, formalized in documents, posted on Jira, and hopefully, by the time the lines of code are written, the game of telephone worked and what was intended actually happened.\t- Bear with me on this one. What does a stereotypical meeting room look like? Table, chairs, TV, phone, and a whiteboard. The whiteboard is probably already littered with cryptic symbols, more lines than a mafia ring diagram, and more names of technology and services than you have friends. What is your gut instinct when you go to write your own ideas on that whiteboard? Do you clear away those ideas without a second thought?

Those are all fabulous ideas! Context captured in time like our ancestors did on the walls of their caves. There is no other language that quite helps us bridge our gap of communication like a diagram. So why don\u2019t our development practices embrace this more?\t- The answer is that there are no tools that are intuitive and complete enough to do this. We might use lucidchart or draw.io to design our system\u2019s architecture, but what happens when it changes? Do you go back through your old digrams to make sure they reflect the real world? And what about the systems those diagrams connect to? Do you connect your diagram to the larger context of your company? Can you go from your diagram on your proposal to the other system\u2019s proposal? My diagrams sure don\u2019t.\t- At Uber, when I wanted to learn how something worked, I would open up the service\u2019s API contract the Thrift IDL or GRPC protobuf. The contents of that file reflected exactly how the service\u2019s API contract existed in production and the reference I needed to develop locally. The types for calling the service could also be generated automatically. The experience was nothing short of intuitive, but I was still solving a problem.\t- At every level of communication, the context from all other levels should be visible. Why do we lose it? It\u2019s hard to organize. People want to communicate in their own ways.

voice talking as as a audio recording that can be picked up by a plug in that you had to lock sake and or actually maybe no you know what you can do is your program can run on GitHub it\u2019s so it\u2019s actually pretty funny because as I\u2019m talking I\u2019m reading back through what I have already said and shit I forgot my train of thought OK so back on this idea so if you have it will like the script where you can go it\u2019s not the script it\u2019s a descript  OK I got it right that time so if you have a tool like the script which can take what you were saying in translated to text I guess it\u2019s it\u2019s still dropping some words that I\u2019m saying so you need to find some thing that has a good AA model of taking speech with microphone and turning it to text like I think there\u2019s a tool open whisper or I guess maybe that\u2019s like the released model so if you could take an open source voice recorder voice to text you can record your voice as audio on iOS save that to your notes get her burrito ever Hito it\u2019s not a burrito what I am saying is that if you take your voice recorded as audio on your iOS phone than that can get transmitted to get home get hub GITHEBGATHEP space space GATHUB this is a vet this speech to text is not very good or I guess it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect and that\u2019s the point it just needs to be good enough that as you\u2019re listening to it it shows you the space on the video or is it the timeline of the video where the thought was sudden thought was said but yet once it\u2019s on GitHub you can run and get up action that will transform your speech into text and then committed to the repo repo\t  \t  [[high thinkies]] https://typesense.org https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27154469- can you freeze a

a coffee shop needs to operate or how much percent of my bill is enough to keep a waiter\u2019s life together and stress free? i see the value of not having a cap on price for those that are willing

everything needs to be run in 10 different places. High school students and teachers all experienced this massive drop in quality and care for the competition. CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop. NYU dropped their golden egg.\t- This was one of the reasons I decided to drop out of NYU. I was being offered a fantastic job at Uber, while having to fight to try to keep the security lab that special place that made it what it was. We weren't able to have a two time HSF finalist get accepted into NYU. Most finalists don't even consider going to NYU as they usually have their sights set on CMU, MIT, etc. A friend of mine, a three time finalist, only decided to go because he would be\u00a0*paid*\u00a0to go to NYU. Another friend would also have been paid, but decided to go elsewhere.\t- There is no competition on the planet that embraces the spirit of HSF (as it was). CTFs encourage a fire and forget mentality, once you have learned the patterns you need to learn. In fighting to preserve the HSF format, I was\u00a0repeatedly told that HSF would not scale, and that was the reason why it became a CTF for highschoolers.\t- I wrote this challenge\u00a0generator, partially out of frustration, to prove that it was possible to scale a competition that encourages cohesive problem solving skills. And even more importantly, it teaches students how to communicate the work that they have done and rewards them for spending that time. The ex-HSF finalists that I still stay in communication with, who remember how HSF was, are frothing at the mouth at the idea of this competition coming back.\t- My dream with rebooting HSF is to preserve the \"magic\" that you feel when you spend a week perusing the evidence, only to look at something for the 10th time and see what you were missing. Or being at finals and being given a phone and a \"good luck\". You were the one who showed me how special this competition was.

that authorization could be better? as in offering libraries to people who build REST apps and providing them a way of enforcing authorization? idk if that question makes sense, but authorization is a huge security problem and that\u2019s kind of why we wanted lunadefend to exist https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/lunadefend/overview/introduction/  a very fast way to protect sensitive data. we already planned on having oathkeeper be the auth proxy that we needed. if there was a dead simple authorization library for major languages then we could get people using it. I was struggling to use ory in my personal projects, and ended up just copying a bunch of files that I created for lunatrace (which were originally from your front end example). but now that you guys have the easy to use react components, it\u2019s a lot easier. The next thing I code, i know ory is the easiest way to get all of my auth things I need for my service.-", "doc_id": "940c0cec-0622-495c-8a2f-45bd37ec67f3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a55d72832956637b99e4b07e189be1ea5960af4e7b53024a8e896fffba4f2041", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "534eacb5-cca9-4d38-b4b3-ec951a6addad", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1241}, "image": null}, "335ecef5-10f6-4ecd-b722-07c1bb3edbf9": {"text": "- https://github.com/opsee/protobuf protobuf to graphql- https://github.com/tmc/protoc-gen-graphql- https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/- https://www.public.asu.edu/~kvanlehn/ITScourse2009/Readings/Burleson%202005.pdf developing creativity- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLcXIrTwPUM flume like a version shooting star- https://remix-page-blocks.vercel.app-", "doc_id": "335ecef5-10f6-4ecd-b722-07c1bb3edbf9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "56e1cb5492f5b3c6e07a3535c38d205e20a03f8c3c1dea65ecb43503b7ee5727", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "acabb607-c7bd-4e0c-8edf-282402754140", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 352}, "image": null}, "3ffc6374-ad24-4856-9308-4991d91d0f18": {"text": "- https://www.cisa.gov/small-business small business security- https://github.com/google/mangle- https://atmos.earth/natural-dyes-synthetic-color-toxic/ history of color-", "doc_id": "3ffc6374-ad24-4856-9308-4991d91d0f18", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9976e9891cd9ebce8703082d98d3bf55b46bdefb6dd581cce72ccded01630fa1", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "e86c92da-cc81-4351-8eb5-2e1d13b22b41", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 170}, "image": null}, "cd5ff24f-361d-4274-b123-2b93a5894372": {"text": "- https://youtu.be/MSq_DCRxOxw #react writing clean code- https://youtu.be/5nKk_-Lvhzo hyperencabulator- https://youtu.be/iM3kjbbKHQU modern python gui- https://naich.net/wordpress/index.php/ever-wondered-why-plumbers-are-paid-so-much/ pipe fittings  id:: 6383b755-7aec-40f6-9639-322c19dfa59f- https://github.com/aappleby/Metron/blob/master/docs/TemporalTLDR.md- https://hub.jhu.edu/2022/11/17/interactive-universe-map/ map of the universe- #ctfg rant #blog  id:: 63e84f3d-682e-454f-98c4-63131ea48fc7\t- I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth with NYU after what they have done with CSAW over time. The fact that HSF became a CTF, quality went downhill, and then now non-existent is something that really bothers me. It had felt to me that there was a complete disregard for the exceptional talent pipeline that Nasir/Poly had established for continuing to build out cyber security at NYU. It feels disrespectful\u00a0to all of the volunteers (you and I included) that worked so hard to not just maintain the quality of the program, but to make it 1% better every year, and make sure everything was in place for it to keep running.\t- The issue has stemmed from the push of making CSAW an international competition. The student\u00a0volunteers were burdened with trying to handle this rapid\u00a0expansion on the fly and the quality of the competition suffered. There was no longer anything \"special\" about CSAW since you can't have physical challenges when everything needs to be run in 10 different places. High school students and teachers all experienced this massive drop in quality and care for the competition. CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop.

CSAW HSF, now CSAW RED, became a massive flop. NYU dropped their golden egg.\t- This was one of the reasons I decided to drop out of NYU. I was being offered a fantastic job at Uber, while having to fight to try to keep the security lab that special place that made it what it was. We weren't able to have a two time HSF finalist get accepted into NYU. Most finalists don't even consider going to NYU as they usually have their sights set on CMU, MIT, etc. A friend of mine, a three time finalist, only decided to go because he would be\u00a0*paid*\u00a0to go to NYU. Another friend would also have been paid, but decided to go elsewhere.\t- There is no competition on the planet that embraces the spirit of HSF (as it was). CTFs encourage a fire and forget mentality, once you have learned the patterns you need to learn. In fighting to preserve the HSF format, I was\u00a0repeatedly told that HSF would not scale, and that was the reason why it became a CTF for highschoolers.\t- I wrote this challenge generator, partially out of frustration, to prove that it was possible to scale a competition that encourages cohesive problem solving skills. And even more importantly, it teaches students how to communicate the work that they have done and rewards them for spending that time. The ex-HSF finalists that I still stay in communication with, who remember how HSF was, are frothing at the mouth at the idea of this competition coming back.\t- My dream with rebooting HSF is to preserve the \"magic\" that you feel when you spend a week perusing the evidence, only to look at something for the 10th time and see what you were missing. Or being at finals and being given a phone and a \"good luck\". You were the one who showed me how special this competition was.

"[[wasp/testing]]- wasp authz rfc https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/584- e of has made me really interested in this area. being able to quickly find meaningful information given some provided context is incredibly powerful. nolan and i have been conceptualizing Protoflow https://breadchris.com/#/page/protoflow%2Fdemo where the aim is to make self contained blocks of code that are strictly typed with protobuf. you can have the wild west of code inside your block, but the types keep the blast radius small (dependency injection only, no global state). once you have isolated blocks, you can deploy them anywhere: lambda, kubes, ecs, etc. this system would let you transform any data you want and be able to reuse and share this data transformer effortlessly. turning an audio file from s3 into text is as simple as calling the \u201cDownload file from s3\u201d and then \u201cAudio file to Text block\u201d. Just thought i would share some thoughts, connecting the dots of a lot of different ideas lol. trying to figure out how to build businesses too so i can fund these ideas, being in YC is really helpful to see how that works.- **11:56** [[quick capture]]:  https://beta.sayhello.so/search?q=how to setup a proxy in express- https://johnazariah.github.io/2022/12/06/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial.html go

Docker tried to make docker swarm happen, but dropped the ball, kubes is obviously what it is today, but is not intuitive like docker-compose is. So we now have this rift between docker local dev experience, and kubernetes deployment magic, and kompose is trying to bridge that gap, and does so pretty damn well imo. What is nice is that it generates a helm chart for you so when you want to eject, you just stop using kompose and you have all your kubes resources. #protoflow- [[protoflow/disrupt stack]] zero to

that you must follow to sharpen a chef's knife\t- :\t  \t  1. Prepare your sharpening tools. You will need a sharpening stone and a honing rod.\t  \t  2. Position the sharpening stone on a flat surface.\t  \t  3. Place the blade of the chef's knife on the sharpening stone at a 20-degree angle.\t  \t  4. Use the honing rod to hold the knife in place.\t  \t  5. Use your other hand to hold the knife's handle.\t  \t  6. Sharpen the blade by moving it back and forth across the sharpening stone.\t  \t  7. Be sure to maintain the 20-degree angle as you sharpen.\t  \t  8. Sharpen the blade until it is sharp.\t  \t  9. Test the blade by slicing a piece of paper. The blade should \t  10. be able to easily slice through the paper.\t  \t  11.

Don't believe me? Then prove me wrong. Every day your developers are unknowingly authorizing external developers to have access to your internal infrastructure. This is happening through dependencies. Let's have a look at how you are hacked.\t- Description: Business requirements are built around the use of dependencies. Features are planned and shipped based on external developers working on projects in their free time. Over the years, developers have felt the pain of what happens when this fragile supply chain falls apart; usually by the hands of a single developer. All eyes are on this problem, but attempts to solve this problem are falling short when it comes to preventing these problems (looking at you SBOM). In this talk, we will be taking a trip down memory lane to remind ourselves how we got here in the first place. Digging into the technical details of notable dependency related events, we will illustrate the painfully mundane problems (ie. version hell) to the incredibly targeted attacks (ex. event-stream). Of course, we are not just here to fear monger. Our work has shown us ways that we can survive this ever growing threat, and steps everyone can take to protect themselves.\t- Notes: A year ago we wrote a blog post about a vulnerability that went viral because it was providing clear, concise recommendations in an otherwise confusing time. The vulnerability being written about, of course, was log4shell. After countless phone calls from people with questions like: \"Should I update from 2.15 to 2.16?\" and \"How can I tell if my fork lift is vulnerable?\", it was clear that people need some real help. Over this past year, we have been diving deep into how we, a world built on code, have ended up with this problem. Having done our homework, we are confident we know how to build code that is", "doc_id": "e719ef28-e6a5-4b74-8954-4843809a4415", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "025fbb69243659ab92609bde0f5b112bf9350c97fc35a79dd137118a053d2594", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "4133d47b-048e-44ce-b7a7-0ad6e3ac3b5e", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2072}, "image": null}, "57ad2e90-3ad5-481b-9641-2f612552915c": {"text": "need some real help.

Having done our homework, we are confident we know how to build code that is more secure. This presentation is a snapshot into our learnings and something, we believe, should be talked about.\t- Take aways:\t\t- For the developers, we hope they will become driven to be proactive in thinking about dependencies the next time they sit down to code. They will have a mental rubric they can use to inquire about the code they are about to use. This is to help stop the bleeding.\t\t- For applying the bandage, we hope security managers/CISOs will be inspired to critically look at the tools they are using for supply chain security and ask the question of \"Am I more secure by using this, or am I more compliant?\"\t- https://pretalx.com/bsidessf2023/me/submissions/- https://www.holopin.io/ badges for achievements- [[ctfg/work]] getting it ready for a demo\t- get the evidence graph working\t- get pages working\t- integration for uploading flags from ctfgen to ctfg\t- deploy ctfg to kubes- [[protoflow/ideas]] coding legos #blog/ideas\t- when you want to prove out your idea, you want it to be frictionless. Or at least, as frictionless as possible. The reason a good coder costs so much is that they have seen so much shit that doesn\u2019t go together and have persevered to make it go together. The best coders have made things fit together so many times that they make a framework to not have to keep making things go together themselves, the code makes it happen. There is an article about why plumbers make so much, and it\u2019s essentially the same reason ((6383b755-7aec-40f6-9639-322c19dfa59f)).\t- When you don\u2019t think about what pipe fittings to use, you get to focus on the fun stuff.

So i made an ETL for my favorite recipe sites, normalized the recipes with NYT's AI model for parsing ingredients https://github.com/nytimes/ingredient-phrase-tagger so I could associate them with the USDA data. Of course, being the engineer I am, I stumbled upon the fact that almost no one has any consistent design patterns for building websites so I found myself rewriting the site 5 times, all the while never quite getting to the point I would have liked to where I am actually associating the volumetric to mass measurements for ingredients.\t  What I really want though is to go to the store and buy what looks good (in season, fresh, or deals). Then come home and find a recipe to make with that.\t  That is what I have been building this to be able to do. I have spent a lot of time designing the schema https://dbdiagram.io/d/633fdc01f0018a1c5fb53234 so that I can create relationships like seasonality of ingredients (with data like https://seasonalfoodguide.org/state/alabama).

the program was so close knit, information would disseminate between the grades and so the younger group of kids would only get that much better. I got involved in cyber security because the older kids competed in a competition that was for hacking and they did very well. So I strived to be like them and compete in competitions. Note that around this time CTFs were gaining traction, but hadn't quite got to the high schoolers yet. So the competition that I got brought up on was Brooklyn Polytechnic (now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Tandon_School_of_Engineering) CSAW HSF (High School Forensics). It was a month long competition for high schoolers where the first round you had to spend a month looking at NCIS-like cyber forensics data online (go to fake website clones of facebook to look at someone's profile, they link to an image they took, image has EXIF data in it that has the next bit of evidence). So this competition was so cool that me and my friends were finalists for the competition. It was so cool, not only did you get an all expenses paid for trip to New york city to compete in finals, you got to also interact with all the other ridiculously smart finalists. They were from all over the country and they were all so cool that we ended up connecting our online social networks with them. A number of my friends today were finalists from that competition, including my roommate.

But that is a whole other rant https://breadchris.com/#/page/63bcdcdd-9e55-4478-aa04-3717ed58f148. \t  \t  This jump started my social network so my friends and I were now networked with the best cyber security people in the US going into college. The college I went to had a cyber security lab (OSIRIS LAB), you have to play a CTF to get admission into the lab, it is pretty cool). It was a place to hang out between classes and work on cyber security stuff (like CTFs, hacking hardware, talking about semantics of programming) like some serious nerds here lol. There were leadership opportunities which meant that I could learn how to be better at organizing people to work on tasks together (which was something i enjoyed). One of those leadership opportunities was running the very same competition that I got into college with, HSF. I was able to take all of the things I learned while playing the competition, and implement them in a competition that every kid in America would get a chance to play with, how cool was that. The mentors that I had helping me put this together were top notch, some of the best roll models to follow in the footsteps of (they are all amazing people who live great lives).\t- I leveraged this lab's network to get me my internships. I worked at BAE systems for two years doing static code analysis to look for 0day vulnerabilities in a product they were using. I then got to intern at Uber which completely changed my life, once again.\t  \t  Working at Uber let me see what choosing the \"right\" things really, really fast looked like.

Millions and millions of dollars.\t  \t  Understanding my impact to the world let me feel confident enough to join @Free Wortley (a coworker of mine from Uber) to work on Refinery. He derisked my decision to jump ship of a well paying job (without a college degree since I dropped out), to get paid way less, but on an opportunity that could change my life. We didn't use our security skills for the first product we were working on, so we changed to developing LunaDefend). This is a project was a work of love. It took the biggest problems that we saw at the other silicon valley companies in regards to security and solved it with this security framework. Unfortunately selling a dev tool is only something that you can do when you have hit a homerun of a product idea, and we just didnt quite get there. ...and then came the big one.\t  \t  As I was walking out the door to go work from the day at free's, @alex told me about a chinese blog that was talking about a vulnerability in a widely used java library. I thought that was interesting, and drove off. Later that day Free and I were talking about what we could write about that might help us solve our SEO problem. What really cool blog post could we write about that would wow HN. I told Free about what alex had told me and we thought about it for a while. How many projects use Log4j? How hard is it to exploit this vulnerability? What could you do if you exploited this? ... wait minecraft kids are using this to crash servers with a chat box message? Could this really be as bad as we think it is?

While this wasn't actually a zero day (there was a version out with a fix) the communication of the vulnerability was lagging so hard that the chinese blog poster actually was looking at the github commit made to patch the vulnerability and writing about it on his own personal blog. This is what alex translated and read to me that morning. We poured over every single ounce of information that we could get our hands on. Pulling up the log4j code. Making a POC of the exploit. Our blog post had links to tweets that others had made. \t  \t  Our blog post gets popular on HN, but it isn't the first result on the page. At the top was another blog post that someone had submitted. Looking at it, it wasn't really that clear as to what you were supposed to do to fix the issue.

So we did both from inside and outside, but still I would say more effort was on the \"outside\" approach, because we wanted the result to be focused on DX (developer experience).\t- So we came up with these \"mockups\" of what writing in this made up language could look like, and then we iterated and iterated on that until we got something that was both satisfying from the DX side but it was also achiavable -> which means we made some trade offs on the way, dropped a thing here or there, only to make it easier to build", "doc_id": "82b3266f-326b-4b36-85e6-2a59e1e662f4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "30d8cdafac2bd2cccb045f6390edd4b34f001b91a7e0e45428c0fe127b8530b8", "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "01a41d4f-1f77-49bd-a44b-33b2720b5076", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1800}, "image": null}, "e35832e9-ffff-4c1d-aea8-3e263df8635b": {"text": "that until we got something that was both satisfying from the DX side but it was also achiavable -> which means we made some trade offs on the way, dropped a thing here or there, only to make it easier to build first version and to get going. Some of those choices included recognizing when a sub-problem is already solved well, and using existing solutions.\t  For example, we recognized that we want to have pages, Operations (Queries and Actions), Entities. That came from the \"outside analysis\". We started designing our own, but soon realized there are solutions that match them very well. We chose React for pages/components because it is a great match + most popular on the market, react-query because it was perfect match (I didn't know about it when I came up with concept of Actions/queries, so when I found it I was thrilled, since it follows the same design very closely). Similar for Prisma, it just fit so well with Entities that it made much more sense to go with it than to build our system from scratch.\t- When choosing solutions, we used two main criteria: how good of a fit it is to what we imagined + how popular it is / might become.\t- It is true that they influence our direction and possibly limit us in some way, but they also:\t  1. Attract a lot of people who are already using those and who feel good knowing that there is familiar ground when using Wasp.\t  2. Sped us up a lot since we then get to focus on other stuff, the \"glue\" of web app, which is anyway what we recognize as the biggest problem.- #ctfg/deployment https://rcds.redpwn.net/en/latest/

If your boat had a hole in it, you would probably patch that hole as fast as you could. You wouldn\u2019t want your boat to take on water and sink right?\t- For a boat that is supposed to be out at sea for months, a hole in your boat spells disaster, but what if your boat didn\u2019t need to sail for months? What if you had a row boat you took out occasionally to do some fishing and that hole is actually pretty small, the only really notice it when you bring your boat to shore and see a bit of water. When are you going to fix that hole? Right then and there? Tomorrow? A week from now? A month?\t- While you would still technically call that hole in your rowboat a \u201cbreach\u201d that lingo doesn\u2019t quite translate to the security world. A \u201cbreach\u201d refers to a known compromise of a system. A breach is the actual action performed by a hacker to exploit a vulnerability.

Often the vulnerability being exploited is one that is already known to exist (as opposed to a zero day).\t- Let\u2019s relate this back to the world of security. A hole in a boat is similar to a vulnerability. Your boat\u2019s hull is supposed to protect you from the water that is always trying to force its way in. Any chance water gets, it will pour in at full force. If there is a vulnerability in your code, hackers will use it to get into your company. The laws of physics dictate how likely water will affect your boat, but with security we don\u2019t quite have the same level of understanding.\t- Like water, a hacker is going to find the hole that gives them the least resistance. If an unpatched Apache Struts instance is running inside of one of the world\u2019s largest credit company, you can be sure that a hacker will exploit this. There is a clear path for the hacker to gain money and/or influence. Continuing this line of thinking, a vulnerability like a regex DOS in an internal web application is not going to give a hacker meaningful leverage, there is just too much resistance for achieving their goal.\t- There are a number of models that have been created to try to categorize and reason about  vulnerabilities an attacker might use (CVSS, EPSS, Attack framework?). Unfortunately, these frameworks in practice do not quite capture the nuance of the different types of holes that can exist in code. Teams (or often times an individual) that manage vulnerabilities at a company find themselves almost exclusively chasing down fixes for holes in their \u201cfishing rowboat\u201d rather than focusing on fixing holes in their more important \u201cships\u201d or mission critical services that process sensitive information.\t- It is ironic that even though vulnerability scanning is almost ubiquitous at companies, they still struggle with locating and fixing them. Log4Shell, possibly the worst vulnerability ever discovered, had taken companies weeks or months to even remotely begin to understand how badly they were affected.

I have found after trying it out for a bit that a lists with indentation are actually the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to take notes (at least for me). it is hard to explain, but i find that everything being a list removes the urge to format notes and just focus on the information. since it\u2019s easy to create a new bullet point and indent it to the logical indentation level, you don\u2019t have to think about \u201cwhat size should i make this heading\u201d? It is all still markdown like obsidian, so you can format things however you want, but the behavior that logseq reinforces of daily journal with lists and tagging ideas has completely changed the way i take notes and at least at the moment it feels like the rest of my life will be building off of this note taking system which feels really cool to think about.

I always have a jars of mayo, yogurt, whipped cream, caramel, pickled onions, among other things in my fridge. You do not need these, but I find they compliment my cheap plastic containers as a higher quality container that has a tight seal and can withstand high heat (they are designed to be boiling water used during the canning process). They sell mason jars in different ounce measurements. 32, 16, 8oz? I think? Will need to check that. They also sell some massive ones which I guess are for some pretty large pickles. You can actually get some \u201cfree\u201d mason jars if you don\u2019t want to spend extra. IMPORTANT NOTE about mason jars.

I open my eyes and think: \"here we go again\". The bed is just way too comfortable to justify leaving it. What is the point? My bed is warm and soft, and the world is not, why would I go out there today? Maybe if I cycle between youtube and instagram for the next hour I can forget about the fact that I have to actually get up.\t- Now, I would say that I enjoy most of my days. Being at a startup, I enjoy the problems I work on. When I need food, I have a nice kitchen where I can make nice food. Being able to work from home is nice. But why is still so hard to actually start my day?\t- Mental inertia is very real, and when the place that you have to move from mentally is one that is quite comfortable, it is very challenging. I find that having a very repetitive morning routine where I can get some reliable dopamine is the winning formula for me. I like to make my own bread, yogurt, and granola so I always have something on hand for breakfast that I deeply enjoy. I actually get excited really every morning to toast some bread, fill a bowl with yogurt/granola, and pour some tea. I found something that works for me.\t- What works for you? How do you justify getting out of bed ever morning? Is it excruciating for you? I don't know if I truly have any advice besides find what works for you. Maybe try to find some food/drink that you enjoy and have it ready for yourself in the morning. Humans are incredibly habitual creatures and maybe you can find a habit that sticks.

Where/how can incentives be placed to attract experienced engineers?\t- that's a really good question.\t  i've met a lot of senior engineers who just want to get shit done. they want to do interesting things, they don't really care about how complex or intricate their code or architecture is. in fact, simplicity, readability, and maintainability are what they strive for. simplicity in the solution, less dependencies, fewer lines of code. readability, avoiding esoteric language features or patterns. maintainability, setting the bar at \"would a junior understand what's going on here?\".\t  i've also met senior engineers who love to flex. contributors and maintainers of open source projects, inventing their own protocols and libraries. hell, even their own programming languages.\t  however, i feel like the latter are fewer and far between -- and nothing protoflow could do would sway them to use the platform. at the end of the day, i believe that if we have great developer experience, and

Think of all the buttons you click on in any given day? You instantly notice when the action that the button performs causes the site/program to hang. Did the action actually complete successfully? What happens when the server the action runs on fails? What is our poor button to do about that? The intersection of UX and code is very difficult. You are simultaneously a teacher and a programmer.

There is a very distinct possibility you will experience \u201cpretentious\u201d vibes from my phrasing/pacing of ideas. Unfortunately writing about philosophy be like that. Stay tuned while I upgrade my written voice to be more relatable.\t- You can think about a lot of different things all the time. Think about too many things and this becomes a serious problem, especially for those who have ADD. If you have a problem focusing on which idea to pursue, it is easy to experience the feeling of being lost. Life is happening, ideas come and go, but there is nothing for you to bring to show and tell.\t- I am not an expert in this field of study, but I do pay attention to what constitutes a \u201cgreat thinker\u201d. Or maybe a better term for the people I am thinking about is a \u201csustainable thinker\u201d.\t- ## Patience\t- A sustainable thinker is one who has, above everything else, patience. An idea will come and go, and it will not phase them. Instead, they take note of it. Often times a physical note, in a place that they frequently take their notes. There is organization to the way they take in information. Over time, these observations grow and connections are formed between fresh observations and older observations. Higher level concepts are synthesized. It becomes effortless to understand an entire domain of information. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. To them this actually might be the beginning of what they consider \u201chaving an idea\u201d. They take their hypothesis wherever they go. To the best of their ability, they will try to find data to suggest what they believe isn\u2019t true.\t- ## Reading\t- A", "doc_id": "6145f8eb-f4f8-44f9-90f9-68bd2c0a9b1e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dfdb396fb2a113451f3ee6b952f29564149eb9b28f3657417c6a684bf760af10", "extra_info": null, "index": 4, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "9463dfe9-bcfa-4e8e-8bdc-6d8913dfa97a", "node_info": {"start": 6963, "end": 8922}, "image": null}, "266eed90-a073-4dab-8148-d8cd512c6f78": {"text": "an idea\u201d. They take their hypothesis wherever they go. To the best of their ability, they will try to find data to suggest what they believe isn\u2019t true.\t- ## Reading\t- A sustainable thinker reads. Often times long form text like books or insightful blogs. There is a purpose to how and what they read. But a very important point here is that these people are not machines that solely exist to consume well thought out content day in/day out. No, these are still humans who enjoy memes and bingeing mindless TV. See, a patient thinker understands the bigger picture. They are human on a planet of humans. Not everyone is like them, and so everyone has something to share. Being able to interact with actual humans through colloquial phrases and honest emotional communication is vital. Honoring the give and take of time and energy that comes with existing is paramount to a sustainable thinker.\t- ## Align with Sustainable Thinkers\t- I try to align myself with the patient thinkers I am fortunate enough to interact with. I find it an immense privilege to be able to ask questions of these people. It makes me feel rewarded to be able to provide well researched insight of my own to my peers.\t- I probably still have too many threads of thought I pull at every day, but I think I am on to something. I kind of have this master plan for what I am working on, but I also realize it will take time. I need to be patient and continue to be present and honest with myself. Through this practice, I have felt immensely rewarded even for doing the smallest of things, like writing a single note for a given day.\t- Regardless if you are or strive to be a sustainable thinker, I wish you all the best on your journey through your own mind \ud83d\ude4f- #blog/ideas Projects\t- I have crippling anxiety when it comes to ideas.

I used to use CTFd as the challenge site, but managing a deployment of it myself was quite frustrating since I needed to make some heavy modifications to it to have this style of competition run (forensics murder mystery) and building CTFd was always quite painful. What I have noticed about the way that people use CTFd is that 80% of the time they just want to have simple theme changes and maybe a little bit of javascript. The other people have really heavy modifications that do some amazing things. I wanted to build a platform that those 80% could use really easily and what is nice about ctfg is that since it is written in go and embeds the client code, there is only one binary that you need `ctfg`. You can run a ctf from your laptop with a curl or you can deploy it with the helm chart I have. I also have a dream for those other 20% of people to let them extend ctfg to suit their needs by letting them use whatever part of the ctfg framework they want https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ctfg/ctfg.\t- Still a work in progress, i only really started building this a couple months ago, but I am running my first ctf with it on tuesday https://ctf.mcpshsf.com/ and pretty excited about it.

Let\u2019s make that easier.\t- Start with Markdown and hugo.  Markdown is trivial to learn and making a website is instant. Hugo is a single binary you download, run and boom there is your website. A number of themes are available for you to check out and play with, but they aren\u2019t necessary to start out.\t- If you want to have more control over how things are formatted and roughly look, html will be the next step of learning. By itself, it will be relatively limited, but you can get pretty far with including a simple css style sheet like this one.\t- If you want to move things around on the page, make them bigger/smaller, red/blue. You are going to need to learn CSS. As you learn more about CSS, you should consider playing with css libraries like bootstrap or tailwindcss which will greatly scale up your abilities as you try to do more complicated and coordinated visual things.\t- When you want things on the page to move around things, you are going to want to learn Javascript. There is a lot that you can do with javascript. Understanding that a webpage is a tree of nested objects with names and identifiers will be important to spend time on. The internet will try to convince you that you need to know React, Angular, Vue, but you just don\u2019t need it right now. These are javascript frameworks that really let you do some crazy things, but stay simple as long as you can. Once you find yourself needing to model a bunch of data on a page, I would recommending learning the javascript framework Svelte. Of all the frameworks, it is, in my opinion, the closest framework to the knowledge you already know about html, css, javascript.\t- If you have learned about html, css, and javascript, you are probably already building some cool", "doc_id": "0e66559b-8e36-4725-90ac-1ba0845ddf10", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "678072f0a54f4af49fa5ab993ceb3ed703ccade7a0da35dcb317cd7762ee8faf", "extra_info": null, "index": 5, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "1131b40b-3a97-4e50-93a9-68f81772c5a5", "node_info": {"start": 9225, "end": 11313}, "image": null}, "b418b595-d341-4525-a215-436f6d67f786": {"text": "it is, in my opinion, the closest framework to the knowledge you already know about html, css, javascript.\t- If you have learned about html, css, and javascript, you are probably already building some cool things. You can still run the same hugo command and generate your website and not needing to think about much. But maybe you want to store data so it doesn\u2019t go away when you refresh the page. If this is the case, you are going to want to build a backend. A backend is complimentary to your frontend as it runs as its own process and listens for requests your frontend sends to it. If you took my advice and learned Svelte, they have a super easy way to build a backend called SvelteKit. If you went with React, there is the great option of NextJS. If you haven\u2019t learned either of these, you will probably want to learn about express and how to build REST api endpoints.\t- If you are feeling pretty good about all of this, then you are well on your way for some serious application development. These are the things that every application developer does every day at their company and you have your own foothold into this whole market. You are super valuable as a result. Look at all the things you know! You must have spent a ton of time looking at the internet for help on building these things and someone will pay for that.
